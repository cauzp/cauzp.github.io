I am currently pursuing a MPhil at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). My supervisor at this master program is [Prof. Corey Kewei XU](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/XU-Kewei/coreyxu). I also have a co-supervisor, [Prof. Jing TANG](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=285). My main research interests are disaster-related online public opinion and the application of large language model agents in the field of disaster risk perception.

I obtained a Bachelor of Administration degree (Regional Development in Rural Areas) and a Bachelor of Science degree (Data Science and Big Data Technology) from [China Agricultural University](https://cau.edu.cn/). At that time I focused on social media online opinion research. My supervisor [Prof. Feng KONG](https://cohd.cau.edu.cn/art/2020/11/27/art_48059_998984.html) is a scholar in the field of disaster and emergency management.
