This study focuses on user discussion differences of the game ''Black Myth: Wukong'' on Douyin and TikTok platforms. This study analyzed 200K comments from Douyin and 100K comments from TikTok, utilizing LLM-based Few Shot Learning for classification. The study highlighted the differences in user discussions due to cultural variations, providing insights for future game design and the international expansion of Chinese games.

This study is focus on user disaster risk perception of the Guangzhou Meida Highway collapse accident on Douyin platform. This study utilized Bertopic for topic modeling and BERT pre-trained model for sentiment analysis, analyzing approximately 50K related comments on Douyin videos. By leveraging ArcGIS for geographical visualization and incorporating Chinese statistical data along with IP geolocation of comments, I elevated the analysis from descriptive to correlational.

This study is focus on online public opinion of the Jishishan earthquake disaster. This study utilized BERT pre-trained model for sentiment distribution analysis, TF-IDF for keyword extraction, and Gephi for visualization, combined with manual topic identification. Analyzed approximately 12K user comments.

\section{Research Experience}
\textbf{Research on Internet Public Opinion of Emergency Events Based on Natural Language Processing}

Supervisor: \href{https://cohd.cau.edu.cn/art/2020/11/27/art_48059_998984.html}{Feng KONG} \hfill Sep 2022 -- Present

I collected social media data from Sina Weibo using a Python-based web crawler, fine-tuning a BERT model to conduct sentiment analysis and generate visualizations. For thematic analysis, I utilized Gephi to perform social network analysis and visually represent the results. Based on these findings, I assessed public opinion trends and provided governance recommendations to inform policy and decision-making.

\textbf{Enhancing Urban Resilience through AI: Modeling, Simulating, and Mitigating Catastrophic Risk Scenarios}

Supervisors: \href{https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/XU-Kewei/coreyxu}{Corey Kewei XU} and \href{https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/TANG-Jing/jingtang}{Jing TANG} \hfill Sep 2023 -- Present

In this research project, I utilize social media data to analyze public risk perception in major sudden natural disaster scenarios. Using large language models, I conduct sentiment analysis and thematic analysis to assess the online public opinion characteristics related to these events. I have extensive experience in collecting and processing social media data from multiple platforms, including over one million data points from Douyin, more than two million from TikTok, and additional data from other sources. Using advanced web crawlers, I efficiently gather diverse datasets, and my strong proficiency in data handling allows me to manage and analyze large-scale social media information seamlessly. I leverage large language models (LLMs) with few-shot learning for text classification, which enables me to conduct in-depth, multilingual sentiment and thematic analyses across various platforms. Additionally, I am skilled in using tools like BERTopic for sophisticated topic modeling, which allows me to provide high-accuracy insights into public sentiment and online opinion trends. I am also proficient in visualization software such as ArcGIS and Gephi, enabling me to create detailed spatial and network visualizations. By integrating Chinese statistical data and performing statistical analyses based on the IP geolocation of comments, I advance my research from descriptive to correlational analysis. This approach provides a deeper understanding of regional differences in public opinion, allowing me to identify patterns and relationships between thematic features and demographic factors.
